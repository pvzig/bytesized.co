title: Building Slack Bots in Swift
path: swift-bots
---
As a remote iOS developer, I love [Slack](https://slack.com). It‚Äôs both my meeting room and my water cooler. As [interest in bots exploded](https://www.techcrunch.com/2015/12/15/trophy-emoji), my interest was piqued. Of course I was interested in writing bots for one of my favorite services! My love of Slack and my love of Apple‚Äôs new programming language, [Swift](https://www.swift.org), came together in the form of [SlackKit](http://www.slackkit.co), a Slack client library for iOS, tvOS, and macOS. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not very practical to have to run your Slack bots on a Mac or iPhone, and SlackKit wasn‚Äôt compatible with Linux‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää[until now](https://github.com/pvzig/SlackKit/tree/linux).

## Zewo to Sixty on Linux
Even in the rapidly changing world of technology, the server-side Swift ecosystem is very new. Apple‚Äôs [Linux Foundation port](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation) is a huge undertaking, as is the work to get [libdispatch](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch), one of the main concurrency frameworks that Foundation relies upon, up and running on the platform. Fortunately, a vibrant ecosystem of open source software has emerged to fill in the gaps left by Apple‚Äôs official libraries. In researching the [possibilities for Swift on Linux](https://bytesized.co/swift-everywhere.html), I discovered the open source organization [Zewo](http://www.zewo.io), a large part of this budding community. If this sounds interesting to you, you should [get involved](https://www.github.com/zewo/zewo)! (Oh, and of course they have a [Slack](http://slack.zewo.io))

## Do You Want to Build a Slack Bot?
The following is a step-by-step guide to writing a Slack bot in Swift and deploying to Heroku. The focus here is on macOS but this is also doable on Linux‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust skip the Xcode steps and use your editor of choice.

_[Update 1/2/2017: I‚Äôve updated these instructions to work with Xcode 8.2.1 and the official release of Swift 3.]_

## Building the Application
For our example application, we‚Äôre going to be making an application that can render judgement on a very specific question: [Robot or Not](https://www.theincomparable.com/robot)?

First, we need to create the directory for our application and initialize the basic project structure.

```
mkdir robot-or-not-bot && cd robot-or-not-bot
swift package init --type executable
```

Next, let‚Äôs edit our `Package.swift` to add the SlackKit package as a dependency:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pvzig/74e7c4e18b60ac05ff8737bdcd12e34d.js"></script>

and generate our development environment:

```
swift package generate-xcodeproj
```

## Show Me the Swift Code!
To create our bot, we need to open the `robot-or-not-bot.xcodeproj` file we just generated, and edit the `main.swift` file in _Sources > robot-or-not-bot_ to contain our bot logic. The following code uses SlackKit to listen for messages directed at our bot and then respond to them by adding a reaction to the inquiry.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pvzig/c8f01710d22bfb6f16a9d26819bca81d.js"></script>
## Setting Up Your Slack Bot
Next, we need to create a bot integration in Slack. You‚Äôll need a Slack that you have administrator access to; if you don‚Äôt already have one of those to play with, go [sign up](https://slack.com/create). Slack is free for small teams.

1. Go here: https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot
2. Enter a name for your bot. We‚Äôre going to go with ‚Äúrobot-or-not-bot‚Äù so there‚Äôs no confusion about our bot‚Äôs sole purpose in life.
3. Click ‚ÄúAdd Bot Integration‚Äù
4. Copy the API token that Slack generates and replace our placeholder token in `main.swift` with the real deal.
## Testing Locally
With our bot token in place, we‚Äôre ready to do some local testing! Back in Xcode, select the robot-or-not-bot command line application target and run your bot (‚åò+R).

Then head over to Slack; robot-or-not-bot‚Äôs user presence indicator should be filled in. It‚Äôs alive!

<img src="/images/itsalive.jpeg" width="95%"/>

To test if it‚Äôs working, ask it if something is a robot:

```
@robot-or-not-bot Darth Vader?
```

robot-or-not-bot should add the üö´ reaction in response to your question, letting you know that [Darth Vader is **not** a robot](https://www.theincomparable.com/robot/3/index.php).

## Deploying to the ‚òÅÔ∏è
Now that it‚Äôs working locally, it‚Äôs time to deploy. To the cloud! We‚Äôre going to be deploying on Heroku, so if you don‚Äôt have an account go and [sign up for a free one](https://signup.heroku.com).

First, we need to add a [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) for Heroku. Back in the terminal, run:

```
echo slackbot: .build/release/robot-or-not-bot > Procfile
```

Next, let‚Äôs check in our code:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -am'robot-or-not-bot powering up'
```

Finally, we‚Äôll setup Heroku:

*1.* Install the Heroku [toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com)
*2.* Log in to Heroku in your terminal:

```
heroku login
```

*3.* Create our application on Heroku and set our buildpack:

```
heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/kylef/heroku-buildpack-swift robot-or-not-bot
```

*4.* Set up our Heroku remote:

```
heroku git:remote -a robot-or-not-bot
```

*5.* Push to master:

```
git push heroku master
```

At this point, you‚Äôll see Heroku go through the build process‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääexciting!

<img src="/images/pushheroku.png" width="95%"/>

## Run It!
Once the build is complete, run:

```
heroku run:detached slackbot
```

Over in Slack, you‚Äôll see robot-or-not-bot‚Äôs user presence indicator fill in. It‚Äôs alive! (again)

<img src="/images/allsystemsgo.png" width="95%"/>

Just to be sure if it‚Äôs working, we should ask it an existential question:

```
@robot-or-not-bot Robot Or Not Bot?
```

robot-or-not-bot will (sadly, I imagine) add the üö´ reaction to your question‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit knows it is just a computer program, not a robot.
## üéä You‚Äôre Done! üéä
Congratulations, you‚Äôve successfully built and deployed a Slack bot written in Swift on to a Linux server!
