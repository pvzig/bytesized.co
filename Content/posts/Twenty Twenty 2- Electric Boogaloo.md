New year, new fonts! 2022 felt like an exiting, a return to normal levels of 21st century chaos. In April we welcomed Honey, an Appenzeller puppy, into our home. She’s energetic, friendly, and loves nothing more than stealing pancakes from the breakfast table when you turn your back. Emma turned five (!!!) and started Pre-K at a school just up the street. Walking her to and from school has been one of the unexpected simple pleasures of my year.

In September I helped launch the [next generation of Huddles](https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/22/23177239/slack-huddles-video-audio-chat-call) for Slack, including video, screen sharing, reactions, and built-in chat. And then I quit! Something about a September job change that I just can’t resist.

Started to pull back from Twitter in response to the total, constant twitshow over there. I migrated my news list back to RSS and keep up with it using [Unread](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unread-an-rss-reader/id1363637349). In addition to news, Twitter’s other primary function for me has been as a quasi-professional network, which is where [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@pvzig) comes in. Elon’s decisions (ban links to competitors! cut off third-party clients!) provoke anger in new segments of nerds at a regular clip, driving more of them away from the bird and into the herd. The Mastodon migration (at least in tech circles) seems to be sticking.

Decided to try out one of the paid search engines instead of Google and switched to [Kagi](https://kagi.com/) for my web searches. The quality of the results has been pretty good, but the quality of the integration with Safari on iOS leaves something to be desired. Hopefully Apple opens up better hooks for choosing a default search provider in a future version of iOS. 

The rest of the best below.
