title: No Place Like the Homescreen

It’s the most coveted real estate in technology — that grid of colorful icons staring back at you whenever you wake up your phone. It’s where our most used and most loved apps live. Despite the chatter about the [end of the app “boom”](http://www.recode.net/2016/6/8/11883518/app-boom-over-snapchat-uber), my homescreen has resisted the entropy afflicting others. Out of the 28 total spots available, 9 have changed from [last year](https://twitter.com/pvzig/status/683132662979162112). This is what my home screen looks like at the beginning of 2017.

## Additions
- **Foursquare**: A [cleaned up design](http://blog.foursquare.com/post/150403667638/meet-the-new-simplified-foursquare) and the best food and drink recommendations make [Foursquare](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/foursquare-city-guide-restaurants/id306934924?mt=8) my go-to where to go app.
- **Uber**: This was the year [Uber](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uber/id368677368?mt=8) really integrated itself into how I get around — I find it especially invaluable while traveling.[^1]
- **1Password**: Waking up to a two-factor authentication prompt that my Apple ID was trying to be accessed from China [got me to finally take my online security seriously](https://twitter.com/pvzig/status/814852107476017153). With the help of [1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8), I’m now a reformed password re-user.

## Subtractions
- **Periscope**: [Periscope](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/periscope-live-video-streaming/id972909677?mt=8) was the app that sat on my homescreen the longest while garnering the least actual use. While fascinating conceptually, most live video is both low quality and low density.
- **Settings**: Mostly obsoleted by the introduction of [Control Center in iOS 7](http://www.macworld.com/article/2048740/get-to-know-ios-7-control-center.html) this legacy inclusion finally got pushed to the second screen this year.
- **iA Writer**: I love [iA Writer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id775737172?mt=8) for long-form writing like this article, but I simply don’t do it on my phone enough to warrant it’s inclusion on page one.

## Replacements
- **Weather Line**: This past summer, I started a new job. It’s close enough that I can bike to work, which I love. That also meant that I needed to know if it was going to rain, and when. [Weather Line](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weather-line-forecast-graphs/id715319015?mt=8) has proven to be a more than worthy replacement for [Perfect Weather](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/perfect-weather-noaa-radar/id695709241?mt=8)[^2]. It presents the important information in a clear, easily readable format and offers an excellent iOS 10 widget.
- **Capsule.ai**: Since [Foursquare split it’s app in two](http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/1/5666062/foursquare-swarm-new-app), I’ve been using [Swarm](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id870161082?mt=8) to keep track of places I go while warding off the social bits I wasn’t interested in. So when I saw [Capsule.ai](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/capsule.ai/id967292138?mt=8) on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com) it was love at first sight. The location inference isn’t as good, but it’s well designed and I’m not constantly fighting off unwanted inquiries to “Share Your Location With Friends!”.
- **Castro 2**: The gentlemen over at [Supertop Squid](http://blog.supertop.co) released a new version of their already excellent podcast app Castro. [Castro 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241?mt=8) helps you organize and prioritize your podcasts using a clever inbox and queue system.
- **Spark**: While I was using [Outlook](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook-email-calendar/id951937596?mt=8) when the ball dropped on 2015, I spent most of the year using the excellent (and confusingly named) [Email](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/email-fast-secure-mail-for/id922793622?mt=8)[^3] by [Easilydo](https://www.easilydo.com). But when [Readdle](https://readdle.com) released an excellent [Mac version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spark-love-your-email-again/id1176895641?mt=12) of their email client [Spark](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spark-love-your-email-again/id997102246?mt=8) with cross-platform sync, I switched. I still find the iOS client a bit clunky but since most of my email management is done on my Mac anyways, the sync features win out.
- **Bear**: [Vesper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vesper/id655895325?mt=8)[^4], the meticulously designed note-taking app from [Q Branch](http://vesperapp.co/blog/) was [shuttered due to business concerns](https://daringfireball.net/2016/08/vesper_adieu) earlier this year. In a category with hundreds of alternatives, nothing filled the void as expertly as [Bear](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1016366447?mt=8). When combined with it’s [Mac version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1091189122?mt=12), it’s simply the best cross-platform notes experience available on Apple platforms.
- **Facebook**: [Facebook Paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Paper), the beautifully designed, if slightly awkward[^5] app from Facebook’s now defunct [Creative Labs division](http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/7/9865624/facebook-creative-labs-shutdown) was also [shut down](http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/30/12062124/facebook-paper-shutdown) this year. There was [only one candidate](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/facebook/id284882215?mt=8) for replacement.

[^1]: I took 15 Uber rides this year.
[^2]: Perfect Weather sadly hasn’t been updated since June of 2015.
[^3]: In an iOS only vacuum, I think that Email is the best iOS email app.
[^4]: Vesper is still available for download on the App Store but no longer has a sync service and is no longer being developed.
[^5]: A horizontal feed is just harder to scan than a vertical one.
