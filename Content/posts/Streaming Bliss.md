In my home office, my gaming PC and my Xbox One share a single [monitor](http://amzn.com/B00SPWPF1O), so I was pretty excited about the Windows 10 Xbox application and the ability to stream games from a Xbox One to a PC. Unfortunately, launch day brought with it a disappointing reality - even on the highest setting, the streaming video was scaled down to 720p, which meant that my  HDMI switcher was sticking around for awhile.

But today, [Microsoft released an update to the Windows 10 Xbox application](http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/18/9172311/xbox-one-update-1080p-game-streaming-windows-10) that unlocked a new high quality streaming option, enabling full 1080p game streaming at 60 frames per second. The visual fidelity of the game streaming was now on par with what I could get straight from the Xbox’s HDMI port - now the only issue was network bandwidth. With my router a floor below, I found that even as the only two devices on the 5GHZ band I was getting frequent stuttering as the connections between my PC and my Xbox struggled to keep up.

Fortunately, if you’re using a single monitor setup like myself, odds are good that your Xbox and PC are close enough to be wired together with an ethernet cable - but the setup isn’t exactly plug and play. Follow the steps below to share your PC’s internet connection with your Xbox One and unlock stutter-free streaming bliss.

1. Connect the PC you will be using for game streaming to the internet.
2. Run an ethernet cable from your Xbox One to your PC.
3. Open the Network Connections control panel on your PC.
4. On your connection to the internet, right click and select ‘Properties’.
5. On the Sharing tab, check ‘Allow other network users to connect through this computer’s Internet connection’ and select the wired ethernet connection to your Xbox from the Home networking connection dropdown list.

Setup complete! Now you can connect to your Xbox One, begin streaming a game, and enjoy the speed and reliability of a wired connection.
