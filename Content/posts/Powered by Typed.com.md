Earlier this year, I took a look at the options for hosting a blog in 2015. I ended up settling on Tumblr, tweeting:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Been playing around with setting up a blog with a custom domain and theme for the past few weeks. Tumblr was BY FAR the easiest.</p>&mdash; Peter Zignego (@pvzig) <a href="https://twitter.com/pvzig/status/588543530454384640">April 16, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Tumblr was always a weird place to host a blog in the traditional sense of the word. I had settled on it because I found their custom theme implementation far simpler than anything else out there. And it’s hard to beat free! But Tumblr is more a social network than a blogging platform - they [introduced messaging](http://support.tumblr.com/post/132943845192/youve-asked-us-for-real-instant-messaging-and) in November. It began to feel like I was having to fight harder and harder against the interface - avoiding reblogs, likes, usernames. So when I visited my site on my iPhone a few days ago and was greeted with a floating banner promoting the tumblr app, I knew it was time for a change.

I had been tangentially aware of Realmac Software’s new [crowd-funded blogging platform](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/typed-a-better-blogging-platform/), [Typed.com](https://www.typed.com). So when Dan Counsell [tweeted](https://twitter.com/dancounsell/status/672109317437411330) about rolling out beta access to theme support, I took the plunge.

A few hours later, I had my transferred my layout, added my old posts, and switched over my domain.

**Things I Liked:**
 - Full customization - there’s no required boilerplate.
 - The [sample theme](https://github.com/realmacsoftware/typed-themes/tree/master/starter) provides a good jumping off point.
 - Simplicity. If you know basic CSS and HTML, you should have no problem customizing your blog to your liking with the help of the [documentation](https://www.typed.com/docs/themes/latest).
 - The [Theme Preview.app](https://dl.devmate.com/com.realmacsoftware.typedthemes/ThemePreview.zip) makes it easy to perfect your theme locally.
 - [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and raw HTML support.
 - The ability to backdate posts. This allowed me to bring over my existing posts with their existing post dates.
 - Post tagging support.

**Things I Disliked:**
 - No ability to preview a post before publishing it. 
 - No post import. You have to bring your posts over one by one using the editor.
 - You have to enter a credit card number to sign up for the 'free trial'. On the [Typed.com](www.typed.com) home page, they explain it like this:

> To ensure your Typed website remains accessible to readers at the end of your trial, we require a credit card to start one.

This is cheesy explanation for what is a customer hostile business decision, plain and simple. When you require a credit card to sign up for your free trial, you’ve already got me questioning your intentions - don’t exacerbate it by trying to bullshit me on _why_.

Would I recommend Typed? That’s a hard question to answer. A recurring subscription is a hard sell for something with a lot of free alternatives out there. If you’re willing to deal with a few annoyances, you could use [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) for free like I was. If you don't need or want to control the design of your blog, you'd be hard pressed to do better than [Medium](https://medium.com) - I’ve been cross posting my blog posts there and find the experience to be excellent. But if you're serious about having a good old-fashioned blog, Typed provides a great experience for a reasonable price.
