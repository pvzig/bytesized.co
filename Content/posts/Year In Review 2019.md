# 2019
Had a second kid! Took time off for paternity leave.
For the first time since 2016 I didn’t change jobs in September. We didn’t move this year and are happily settling (back) into our life here in Durham, NC. 

Shipped some software — I updated my [personal website](www.launchsoft.co), shipped a macOS Catalina compatibility update for [Later](launchsoft.co/later.html) and helped build the new [App Home surface for Slack](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/theres-no-place-like-home-8a710b614a9d). Got interested in gRPC, microservices, and Kubernetes. Remained interested in Swift.
