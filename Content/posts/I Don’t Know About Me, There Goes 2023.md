Started the year with an extended dad-batical before starting a new job with Block (in September, of course). It’s been invigorating digging in on a bunch of new things all at once. I’m back where I like to be — outside my comfort zone, stretching, learning every day.

Both kids are in school now, and time feels like sand slipping through my fingers. They’re screaming towards the end of that first magical period of consciousness, where the world unfolds in front of them with unicorns and Santa Claus and questions and language. Any day might be the last blueberry pampake breakfast, the last time they stuff books and a lunch into their pack-pack. At school pronunciation is something to be corrected, tongues untied. We lost unicorns earlier this fall — Emma’s favorite animal is the turtle now[^1].

Was fortunate to do quite a bit of traveling this year. Spent an incredible ten days traveling across Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Escaped the winter chill and laid on a beach. Weddings in Breckenridge and the Catskills. 

Listened to a lot of [Goose](https://www.goosetheband.com/)[^2]. Didn’t get to read, watch, or play 10% of what I’d like to, as usual.
